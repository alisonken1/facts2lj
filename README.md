===========

F.A.C.T.S. output to laserjet conversion scripts.

Convert F.A.C.T.S. (Basis International Business Basic program) text output
to postscript for clean, (semi-)professional printouts.

Scripts are written for Bash v3.1 as used by Slackware v12.0.

Postscript output is designed for Abletronics (http://abletronics.com)
internal use.

This is a refactoring of the multiple scripts originally created piecemeal
when old printing system of dot-matrix printers and multi-page continuous
feed paper were replaced with laserjet printers.

Directory structure:
/facts                  Base directory of original install
/facts/bash             facts2lj shell scripts
/facts/work             Working directory for script output
/facts/tmp              Temp directory (also used by FACTS)
